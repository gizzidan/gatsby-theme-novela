# The Hum (previously Shoreside News)

I Started with the Novela theme by [Narative](https://www.narative.co) and heavily customized it to build this website. You can check it out [here](https://thehum.co).

## Tech

This site is built on Gatsby, the static site generator built on React. Styling is done with Emotion (a component based stlying framework), Contentful is used as the CMS, and Netlify for deployment.
